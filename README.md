# Conversion of Sign Language to Text
 
 Conversion of Sign Language to Text. Developed a machine learning-based system to translate sign language
 gestures into written text using TensorFlow and Open CV. Achieved over 70 percent accuracy in real-time gesture
 recognition, significantly improving communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals.

It focuses on developing a system that translates hand gestures used in sign language into readable text. The primary goal is to bridge communication gaps between hearing-impaired individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language. This system leverages technologies such as image processing, gesture recognition, and machine learning to accurately identify and interpret hand movements, converting them into corresponding text outputs in real-time. This project has the potential to significantly improve accessibility and inclusivity in everyday communication.
